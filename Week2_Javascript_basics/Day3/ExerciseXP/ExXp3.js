// Exercise 3 : Repeat The Question
// Instructions
// Prompt the user for a number.
// Hint : Check the data type you receive from the prompt (ie. Use the typeof method)

// While the number is smaller than 10 continue asking the user for a new number.
// Tip : Which while loop is more relevant for this situation?


let num = +prompt("choose a num , *enter 10 to exit");

while (num < 10) {
    num = +prompt("choose a num , *enter 10 to exit");
}
